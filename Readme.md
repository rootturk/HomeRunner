# HomeRunner Message API

  

The HomeRunner Messaging API has been created to provide endpoints such as user registration, user login, sending messages, recording activities, viewing activities.

  

Start the App With System

  

```sh

node index.js

```

Start The App with Docker

```sh

docker-compose-up

```

## API Endpoints
/api/user/register

```sh
{
	"username":"homerunner",
	"name":"HomeRunner Test",
	"password":"dockerize",
	"email":"homerunner@homerunner.com",
	"age":24
}
```
  /api/user/login
Request
```sh
{
	"username":"homerunner",
	"password":"dockerize"
}
```
Response
```sh
{
	"data": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjoiNjI0YzM1ZTZlMDQ2NDlkY2JjZWVmNmZlIiwiZW1haWwiOiJha2luQGhvbWVydW5uZXIuY29tIiwidXNlcm5hbWUiOiJob21lcnVuIiwiaWF0IjoxNjQ5MTYyMjA3LCJleHAiOjE2NDkxODAyMDd9.7K1P5OFzs98h6EgOj2rSURajemPL02vKWWV7ZlSVunM",
	"msg": "Success",
	"code": 200
}
```
  
If you login after you need to 'x-access-token' parameter for authentication methods.


## Tech & Methods

  
HomeRunner Message API uses a number of open source projects to work properly:
  

- [NodeJS] - evented I/O for the backend!

- [ExpressJS] - MVC Framework for NodeJS

- [Mocha] - Test Framework

- [Chai] - Test Framework

- [Winston] - Log Framework for NodeJS

- [MongoDB] - Fast & Scalable NoSQL database

- [JWT] - Token Based Authentication

  
  

## Main Goals

- (+) Users should be able to create an account and log in.

- (+) Users can message others as long as they know each other's usernames.

- (+) Users should be able to access their message history.

  

## Technical Requirements

- (+) Endpoints should follow REST principles.

- (+) Should be dockerized, and expected to run via docker-compose.

- (+) Source code should be uploaded to an online git repository (github, gitlab, etc.)

- (+) Should include unit tests.

- (+) NoSQL database should be preferred.

- (+) Should have structured logging with an appropriate log management solution. (ie. winston+es for nodejs

or serilog+es for dotnet)

  
## Optional Features

- (+) Can include functional tests and integration tests.

- (+) Users can block any senderâ€™s username to stop receiving messages.

- (+) Users can view their own activity logs (ie. successful or invalid logins)

- Messaging can be real-time or can follow event-driven architecture.


## Future

- All endpoints will be placed under controller files. (userController, messageController) etc.
- Integration test
- Swagger integration.
